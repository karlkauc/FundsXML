# What is FundsXML

##### FundsXML is a powerful XML standard format for easy exchange of fund related data between:

- Asset Managers
- Clients
- Distributors
- Custodians
- Authorities
- Vendors
- Advisors



##### FundsXML is transporting:

- Fund Static Data (Name, Identifiers, Type, Manager, Administrator, …)
- Fund Dynamic Data (Total Net Asset Values, Risk Figures, Break Downs, …)
- Portfolio Data (Holdings, Transactions, Earnings, …)
- Share Class Data (ISIN, Type, Net Asset Values, Performance, Subs/Reds, …)
- Asset Management Company Dynamic Data
- Asset Master Data (Details of Securities, Derivatives and OTC Instruments)
- Regulatory Reporting (MiFID II/EMT, EMIR, KIID, PRIIPS/EPT/CEPT, Solvency II/TPT, …)
- Documents (Factsheet, KIID, Prospectus, Reports, …)
- Country Specific Data



##### Advantages in contrast to CSV format:

- Clear file structure and formatting (number, dates, …)
- Native support for nested loops, optional fields and sections
- Definition of fields and tree structure via XML-Schema
- Built in documentation in multiple languages
- Automatic validation of file structure and field content against XML-Schema



##### Licence

The organisation FundsXML.org administrates the XML patterns with the aim to establish these patterns as a unified standard. For this reason each company and single person shall be allowed to download and use these file formats and the documentations and files going with them from the FundsXML website. This is why FundsXML.org decided to put all patterns, files and documentations going with them under the Mozilla Public Licence (MPL).
