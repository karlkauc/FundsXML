##### Licence

The organisation FundsXML.org administrates the XML patterns with the aim to establish these patterns as a unified standard. For this reason each company and single person shall be allowed to download and use these file formats and the documentations and files going with them from the FundsXML website. This is why FundsXML.org decided to put all patterns, files and documentations going with them under the Mozilla Public Licence (MPL).
